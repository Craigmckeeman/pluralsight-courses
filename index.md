## Course List

> ***I'll update this as time permits, I'm busy wrapping up my `jenkins-getting-started` update (2nd edition). After that I'll link in all my courses. I'll group courses by relationship too so you can follow my work almost in a path like format!***

## Jenkins

- WIP Jenkins Getting Started (2nd Edition) 
  - (LINK COMING SOON)
  - Primary course repo: https://github.com/g0t4/jenkins-getting-started
- [Jenkins Getting Started 2 (1st Edition)](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started)
    - Jenkins is a solid product and so content in the 1st Edition is largely relevant. And there are things we chose to cut so it fit into a path for Jenkins that had other courses that expanded on topics like `plugins` so if you want my take on that subject watch the appropos content from the 1st Edition as some of it didn't make my cuts into the 2nd Edition's shorter version.
